## Blog Overview and Background
COVID-19 has had severe implications on the Pennsylvania economy: shuttered businesses, furloughed and laid off employees, and ambiguous timelines on when we can expect a return to "normal". Through a series of vignettes, this blog strives to shed light on 2020 employment trends across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We will discuss how different industries and geographic areas within the state have been impacted and where they are in their recovery as the economy has slowly reopened. Through each vignette, we will frame our discussion around workforce development, providing thoughts and ideas for Pennsylvania to better target resources aimed at supporting individuals find and maintain a job.

We will begin with this post as a high-level overview and later posts will dive deeper into different aspects of employment trends we are seeing in Pennsylvania. 

## Workforce Development in PA

The above map visualizes Pennsylvania's 23 Workforce Development Areas (WDAs), or regions within the state that maintain governing bodies overseeing workforce development activities and services for the constituents of that region. The ways in which WDAs distribute and target resourcing will play a critical role in the recovery of Pennsylvania's economy through the support of a labor force seeking new work opportunities.

## Blog Overview and Background
COVID-19 has had severe implications on the Pennsylvania economy: shuttered businesses, furloughed and laid off employees, and ambiguous timelines on when we can expect a return to "normal". Through a series of vignettes, this blog strives to shed light on 2020 employment trends across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We will discuss how different industries and geographic areas within the state have been impacted and where they are in their recovery as the economy has slowly reopened. Through each vignette, we will frame our discussion around workforce development, providing thoughts and ideas for Pennsylvania to better target resources aimed at supporting individuals find and maintain a job.

We will begin with this post as a high-level overview and later posts will dive deeper into different aspects of employment trends we are seeing in Pennsylvania. 

## Workforce Development in PA
![wda-map]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/WDA_Map.png)

The above map visualizes Pennsylvania's 23 Workforce Development Areas (WDAs), or regions within the state that maintain governing bodies overseeing workforce development activities and services for the constituents of that region. The ways in which WDAs distribute and target resourcing will play a critical role in the recovery of Pennsylvania's economy through the support of a labor force seeking new work opportunities. 

## Employment Impacts

<div id="hv-chart-1"></div>

**Unemployment claims** in Pennsylvania skyrocketed in March and April as businesses began to close and employees were out of work. The above chart shows unemployment claim totals in 2020, broken out by initial and continuous claims. An initial claim is any new unemployment claim for an individual that does not currently have unemployment benefits. A continuous claim is any unemployment claim for an individual that is currently collecting unemployment benefits and requires the continuation of said benefits. Although these are calculated weekly, the monthly claim totals reflect the first week of each month. December claims totals are incomplete.

Although the number of people collecting unemployment has steadily improved since peaking in May at more than 2.7 million claims across the state, the number of initial and continuous claims still remain at pre-pandemic levels. Another item of note is that unemployment benefits expire after 39 weeks, and thus many individuals that have remained on unemployment since March and April will soon be unable to continue collecting benefits in Pennsylvania.

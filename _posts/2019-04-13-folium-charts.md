# Section 1
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania’s largest city, has experienced significant challenges throughout the pandemic as the city has been forced to add restrictions, such as closing indoor dining and limit gatherings, as the city continues to see spikes in coronavirus cases.  Since the pandemic began, over 250,000 residents have filed for unemployment.   Even though the total amount of Philadelphian residents on employment has slowly declined, Philadelphia is still far away from reaching pre-pandemic levels.  The chart below shows the unemployment claims in Philadelphia broken out by continuous and initial claims.

Several of Philadelphia’s key industries include manufacturing, health care, higher education, manufacturing, food processing, biotech, and tourism.  While some of these industries in Philadelphia, including higher education and biotech, have remained minimally impacted by the pandemic, health care and tourism have taken a big hit, accounting for 35% of the city’s unemployment claims.

Compared to other large urban counties (including Allegheny, Montgomery, and Delaware) Philadelphia has experienced a similar trend of unemployment across all industries. As shown in the chart below, the share of Philadelphia’s unemployment claims are slightly higher in Accommodation and Food and Health Care compared to other large urban areas, but lower in Construction.

The high levels of unemployment claims in the hospitality industry has made it even more challenging for people to find jobs in a city that is growing in education and biotech, which require a specific set of skills or experience. Many Philadelphian’s who are unemployed are most likely struggling to find jobs in other fields due to the limitation of transferable skills.  

Some jobs have started to come back in Pennsylvania, but Philadelphia is still far behind in reaching similar levels before the pandemic.   Based on Pennsylvania’s Department of Labor & Industry, job postings in Philadelphia have remained at a similar level throughout the pandemic, far behind 2019 levels.

At the beginning of the pandemic, American Job Centers closed and eventually started to offer career services remotely.  Philadelphia’s CareerLink Centers, career service centers managed by Philadelphia’s workforce development board, have been operating remotely to help residents through their job search, but they are most likely facing resource capacity issues due to the high demand.  As unemployment benefits start to expire, there is now a greater need for Philadelphia’s WDA to priority funding and programming in workforce development.

## Urban vs. Rural PA
**Major industries** vary throughout Pennsylvania based on urban and rural environments.  Typically, manufacturing jobs are located outside the urban core in less dense areas while a majority of food and dining jobs are in cities.  Considering that industries and population vary across regions, it is important to analyze the economic impacts based on geographical context.

According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html">U.S. Census Bureau’s definition of urban and rural areas</a>, thirty out of Pennsylvania’s sixty-seven counties are rural while the rest are urban.  However, since a majority (90% or 11 million) of Pennsylvanians reside in urban counties, we divided them into two groups based on population density (1,500 people per square mile): small urban counties and large urban counties.  Based on this method, we identify thirty rural counties, thirty-three small urban counties, and four large urban counties (Philadelphia, Allegheny, Montgomery, and Delaware).  The map above visualizes Pennsylvania’s 67 counties based on this urban-rural classification.

## Employment Impacts
**Unemployment claims** in all three urban-rural groups spiked immediately after the pandemic began and started to significantly decline at the beginning of the summer, matching state level trends discussed in our first post **COVID-19: Employment Impacts and Recovery**.  The chart below shows continuous unemployment claims in 2020 for each urban-rural classification.

As of November, unemployment claims are beginning to approach pre-pandemic levels.  Out of all three groups, rural counties are the closest, where approximately 28,000 rural county residents remain on unemployment compared to 19,300 claims reported at the beginning of March.  Urban counties are following a slower recovery where unemployment claims for small urban counties is more than double (182k vs. 75k) pre-pandemic levels and almost four times greater (140k vs 36k) for large urban counties.  

## Industry Trends
**Among** PA’s 2020 unemployment claims, Heath Care (14%), Manufacturing (14%), Accommodation and Food (14%), and Construction (12%) make up the four highest shares, accounting for over 50% of all initial claims.   Across all three urban-rural groups, Construction, Health Care, and Accommodation and Food industries were reported to be among the industries with the highest share of claims. The chart below shows the share of unemployment claims in 2020 by industry for each urban-rural classification. Unsurprisingly, the Accommodation and Food industry has the highest share (16%) of unemployment claims in large urban areas while Manufacturing accounts for one-quarter of all claims in rural counties and 15% of small urban claims.

Although continuous unemployment claims have declined, each industry is recovering at a different rate.  Depending upon the urban-rural group, some industries are improving while others are still drastically suffering.  The chart below compares the share of continuous unemployment claims in a specific urban-rural group by industry during the peak of unemployment (May 2020) versus a recent snapshot in November 2020. For example, in large urban areas, the share of unemployment claims increased from 14% to 21% in health care while it remained at a consistent rate across rural and small urban areas. Considering the different trends across each geographic group, workforce development resources will need to be targeted differently in urban and rural areas based on the industries impacted in these regions.

## PA Industry Analysis

**Although** employees in healthcare, manufacturing, and food and accommodation services have experienced exacerbated levels of unemployment in 2020, industries have been impacted differently across the Commonwealth. In more rural areas like the North Central WDA, agricultural industries have been harder hit and urban areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have seen higher job losses in the arts and entertainment industry. 

As each WDA's Workforce Development Board considers next steps to address the short and long-term impacts of the pandemic on the job market, it remains critical that they tailor strategies to the constituents of the region. Training and resource allocation will likely look different not just in quantity of services provided by the WDA, but also in terms of service type. Additionally, certain industries may bounce back faster than others and some may disappear permanently.

**The** map below breaks out the percentage of unemployment claims within each WDA that the selected industry has made up in 2020. One particular industry trend of note is in construction, where we can see higher percentages of job loss in the western part of the state, while the eastern part, including Philadelphia, has fared significantly better. In contrast, there has been a concentration of healthcare job losses on the eastern part of the state. Although we discuss this further in our blog post **Location, Location, Location?**, there are also clear differences in urban and rural job loss concentration including in the professional and management sectors.

## Vulnerable Industries

**Just** as certain industries have struggled more than others, employees from different industies have and will be more vulnerable to the economic impacts of job loss. The difference in average annual wages between top and bottom earners is more than $100,000. As the retail, restaurant, and tourism industries have particularly struggled in terms of job loss this year, workers in these industries will likely be particularly susceptible to economic hardship. Job training and placement for these workers in both the short- and long-term will be critical to protecting the livelihoods of these individuals and their families. WDA-led initiatives could target these more vulnerable groups through programming to more expeditiously stablilize the financial situations of these individuals from entering a place of further financial precarity.

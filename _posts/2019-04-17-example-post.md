## Urban vs. Rural PA

Major industries vary throughout Pennsylvania based on urban and rural environments.  Typically, manufacturing jobs are located outside the urban core in lower dense areas while a majority of food and dining jobs are in cities.  Considering that industries and population vary across regions, it is important to analyze the economic impacts based on geographical context.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s definition of urban and rural areas, thirty out of Pennsylvania’s sixty-seven counties are rural while the rest are urban.  However, since a majority (90%) of Pennsylvanians resides in urban counties, we divided them into two groups based on population density (1,500 people per square mile): small urban counties and large urban counties.  Based on this method, we identify thirty rural counties, thirty-three small urban counties, and four large urban counties (Philadelphia, Allegheny, Montgomery, and Delaware).  The map above visualizes Pennsylvania’s 67 counties based on this urban-rural classification.

# Employment Impacts
Unemployment claims in all three urban-rural groups spiked immediately after the pandemic began and started to significantly decline at the beginning of the summer, matching state level trends discussed in our first post COVID-19: Employment Impacts and Recovery.  The chart above shows continuous unemployment claims in 2020 for each urban-rural classification.

As of November, unemployment claims are beginning to approach pre-pandemic levels.  Out of all three groups, rural counties are the closest, where approximately 28,000 rural county residents remain on unemployment compared to 19,300 claims reported at the beginning of March.  Urban counties are following a slower recovery, where unemployment claims for small urban residents is more than double (182k vs. 75k) pre-pandemic levels and almost four times greater (36k vs 140k) for large urban residents.
